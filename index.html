<!-- I know this isn't anything special. I had this idea for a while though. A couple of years to be exact. I always wanted to create a video streaming service of my own like YouTube or Vimmeo, but I already know I won't get that big. -->
<!-- Here's an FAQ kinda thing
-What do you plan on doing with this?
I have no idea. Again, I've wanted to make something like YouTube but I probably won't make it that far.

-God dammit another service to censor people?
I don't plan on censoring people on this platform. I believe in a free internet. One where censorship and data collection isn't a thing. But of course there will be rules. There will have to be rules. I don't like seeing NSFW.

-So f# YouTube?
No. YouTube is a wonderful platform. In recent years it has had its issues. I don't plan on completely making a replacement of YouTube. Just a place where you can escape the grasp of Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and TikTok (Oh god especially TikTok that sh# toxic as f#)

-Why the hell am I reading this?
I have no idea. Why are you reading this? -->
